  How to use rivers and sea data 
</h1>

<p class="govuk-body">
  Rivers and sea data layers are given to help you further investigate flood risk. 

</br></br>

  In some locations the rivers and sea supporting layers may show inconsistent results.  
</p>


<h2 class="govuk-heading-m">
  What are the rivers and sea supporting layers? 
</h2>

<p class="govuk-body">
  For the first time, we have published additional layers showing rivers and sea flood risk alongside the flood zones.  
</p>
<p class="govuk-body">
  These show flood risk with defences and without defences, for the present day and with climate change.
</p>
<p class="govuk-body">
  The new data supports developers to meet the requirements of national planning policy and guidance. 
</p>


<h2 class="govuk-heading-m">
  How should the data be used? 
</h2>

<p class="govuk-body">
  The table below explains how the datasets shown on the flood map should be used in planning.

      Examples 
    </h2>

<p class="govuk-body">
  The following examples aim to help you understand the table. 
</p>
<p class="govuk-body">
  "My site is in flood zone 1 but is within the rivers and sea 1 in 1,000 undefended climate change extent. Do I need a flood risk assessment?" 
</p>
<p class="govuk-body">
  Yes. Development could be at risk of flooding during its lifetime, so a flood risk assessment should be carried out. 
</p>

<p class="govuk-body">
  "My proposed housing development is in the rivers and sea 1 in 30 defended present day extent. Can I assume this is functional floodplain (flood zone 3b) when checking if the development is incompatible?" 
</p>

<p class="govuk-body">
  No, you shouldn’t assume that this area is functional floodplain (flood zone 3b). You should first check the local planning authority’s strategic flood risk assessment (SFRA) to see if it has designated the site functional floodplain. If the SFRA doesn’t contain suitable information on functional floodplain, you’ll need to undertake your own assessment, informed by the rivers and sea 1 in 30 defended present day extent and the water storage areas layer.  
</p>

<h2 class="govuk-heading-m">
  Data for flood risk assessments 
</h2>

<p class="govuk-body">
  Users of any flood risk data should always satisfy themselves that it is suitable for its intended use. No flood risk modelling data is perfect.  
</p>

<p class="govuk-body">
  To produce a suitable flood risk assessment, other datasets and assessments will be needed. 
</p>
<h2 class="govuk-heading-m">
  Flood zones 
</h2>

<p class="govuk-body">
  We continue to have a high level of confidence in the flood zones.  
</p>

<p class="govuk-body">
  The flood zones are the statutory triggers for local planning authorities to check if they must consult the Environment Agency or apply standing advice.  
</p>

<p class="govuk-body">
  You can find out if the Environment Agency will be consulted on your application or if flood risk standing advice applies, by visiting Flood risk assessments: applying for planning permission. 
</p>

<h2 class="govuk-heading-m">
  What inconsistent results do the layers sometimes show and why? 
</h2>

<p class="govuk-body">
  In some locations the new rivers and sea supporting layers show inconsistent results. Examples include: 
</p>

<ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
  <li>
    1 in 30 defended extents being bigger than 1 in 100 defended extents 
  </li>
  <li>
    Defended extents being larger than undefended extents
  </li>
</ul>

<p class="govuk-body">
  These issues only exist in some locations. 
  
</br></br>The Flood Zones are not affected by these issues. 
</p>

<p class="govuk-body">
  We have produced these layers using a new process as part of our new national flood risk assessment (NaFRA2). NaFRA2 brings together local modelling and national modelling. In a given location: 
</p>

<ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
<li>
  all the layers could be from local modelling 
</li>
<li>
  all the layers could be from national modelling  
</li>
<li>
  some layers could be from local modelling and others from national modelling  
</li>
</ul>

<p class="govuk-body">
  The main reasons for inconsistent results in these layers are: 
</p>
<ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
  <li>
    results showing differences in modelling (for example between national and local modelling) 
    </li>
  <li>
    results showing poor data quality - in some known locations we are working on important improvements to the new supporting layers (in those locations we have retained our previous flood zones while these improvements are made) 
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 class="govuk-heading-m">
  What are we doing about the inconsistent results? 
</h2>
<p class="govuk-body">
  We are analysing the new data to better understand these issues.  
</p>
<p class="govuk-body">
  Improvements and updates are planned later in 2025/26, which will help to resolve many of these issues.  
</p>
<p class="govuk-body">
  We may make further updates to the flood map for planning to highlight where we know inconsistent results exist.
