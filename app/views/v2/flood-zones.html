            Flood zones and what they mean  
          </h1>

            <p>Flood zones show areas of land that could flood from rivers (fluvial) or the sea (tidal), ignoring the benefits of any existing flood defences. </p>
          </br>
            <p>They are based on a location's chance of flooding from rivers or the sea in any year.  </p>
        </br>

            <p>Flood zones do not take into account: </p>
        </br>

            <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
                <li>other sources of flooding </li>
                <li>the possible effects of climate change on rivers or the sea </li>
            </ul>
      

            <p>This means a site in flood zone 1 could still flood now or in the future. </p>
        </br>

            <p>Flood zones combine several datasets to create a picture of flood risk, including:  </p>
        </br>

            <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
                <li>undefended modelling</li>
                <li>defended modelling</li>
                <li>recorded flood outlines from past floods </li>
                <li>other suitable data from third parties  </li>
            </ul>
       

            <p>Flood zones take account of flood risk from watercourses with a catchment area greater than 3 square kilometres. They do not have to be classified as main rivers.  </p>
        </br>

            <p>Where we have data for watercourses with catchments smaller than 3 square kilometres, we will include it in the flood zones if we consider it suitable.  </p>
        </br>

            <p>If a smaller catchment is not included in a flood zone it does not necessarily mean there is no flood risk. If your site is in a smaller catchment not included in a flood zone, you may need further assessment to understand all the risks. </p>
        </br>
    </br>

            <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">Flood zone 1 </h2>

            <p>Locations in flood zone 1 have a low probability of flooding.  </p>
        </br>

            <p>This means, in any year, land has a less than 0.1% (1 in 1,000) chance of flooding from rivers or the sea. </p>
        </br>

            <p>Some flood zone 1 developments need a flood risk assessment as part of their planning application.  </p>
        </br>

            <p>Find out <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/flood-risk-assessment-for-planning-applications#when-you-need-an-assessment"> when you need a flood risk assessment for development in flood zone 1</a>.
            </p>

        </br>
    </br>

            <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">Flood zone 2 </h2>
            <p>Locations in flood zone 2 have a medium probability of flooding.  </p>
        </br>

            <p>This means, in any year, land has: </p>
        </br>

            <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
                <li>between a 1% and 0.1% (between 1 in 100 and 1 in 1,000) chance of flooding from rivers </li>
                <li>between a 0.5% and 0.1% (between 1 in 200 and 1 in 1,000) chance of flooding from the sea. </li>
            </ul>
   

            <p>Flood zone 2 developments need a flood risk assessment as part of their planning application. </p>
        </br>
    </br>

            <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">Flood zone 3 </h2>
            <p>Locations in flood zone 3 have a high probability of flooding.  </p>
        </br>

            <p>This means, in any year, land has:  </p>
        </br>

            <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
                <li>a 1% (1 in 100) or more chance of flooding from rivers </li>
                <li>a 0.5% (1 in 200) or more chance of flooding from the sea. </li>
            </ul> 
              

            <p>Flood zone 3 developments need a flood risk assessment as part of their planning application. </p>
        </br>
    </br>

            <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">Flood zone 3b (functional floodplain) </h2>
        
            <p>Locations in flood zone 3b are at the highest risk of flooding. </p>
        </br>

            <p>Flood zone 3b is not shown on the flood map for planning service, as it is defined and mapped by local planning authorities (LPAs) in their strategic flood risk assessments. </p>
        </br>

    </br>

            <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">The difference between flood zones and flood extents </h2>
            <p>Flood zones are sometimes different to the present day rivers and the sea extents because they combine several additional datasets to create a more complete picture of flood risk.  </p>
        </br>

    </br>

            <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">Flood defences </h2>
            <p>Flood defences: </p>
        </br>

            <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
                <li>reduce the probability of flooding from a specific source (a river or the sea) </li>
                <li>do not completely stop the chance of flooding because there may be a flood that is bigger than the one the defence is designed to protect against (this is called overtopping), or the defence can fail </li>
                <li>may provide reduced protection over time because of climate change increasing flood risk in the future </li>
            </ul>
        </br>

        <p>There are different types of flood defence. They include: </p>
    </br>

            <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
                    <li>embankments </li>
                    <li>flood gates that are in line with the river </li>
                    <li>flood walls </li>
            </ul>

            <p>You can view a complete list of flood defences, called asset categories, on the <a href="https://environment.data.gov.uk/asset-management/drl-app/revision/current/categories#Defence">Defra data services platform</a>. </p>
